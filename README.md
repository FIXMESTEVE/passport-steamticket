This is a strategy for passport.js that uses Steam Auth Tickets for sessionless auth based on the Steam ID extracted from the ticket.


This is different than passport-steam, which makes use of Steam's OpenID login.


You may be interested in this strategy if your Steam game client needs to be authenticated on your backend. If you don't know what is and how to use a Steam Auth Ticket, get in touch with Valve.
